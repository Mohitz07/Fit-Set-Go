# Fit Set Go

Fit Set Go is a smart, interactive web application that calculates a user's maintenance calorie needs based on personal details such as age, height, weight, activity level, and fitness goals. It then generates a personalized meal plan using AI (Gemini) and allows users to download this plan as a PDF.
